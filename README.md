Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide users the ability to filter UFO sightings by more specific criteria such as city, state, country, and shape. The data filter was useful but a bit broad as not all find the rate of occurrences as useful as the location of them. With the added filters, a user may be able to pinpoint specific sightings for the purpose of verifying the sighting with other sources or finding patterns for certain areas.
Results
For someone interested in finding out if there were any UFO sightings near them, they should follow these steps:
1. Visit the UFO Finder webpage
2. Enter the city/state that they live in and then press tab to initiate the filtering 
3. Navigate the results to discover if any UFOs were spotted nearby

Summary
In conclusion, the new design works pretty fast and efficient for the amount of data that is present. One draw back if having to navigate to another input box in order for results to update. I would recommend coding in another listening event that responds per click letter. I would also recommend a clear button to quickly clear inputted information and enter new searches faster than having to erase it manually.
